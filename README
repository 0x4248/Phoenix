Phoenix
====================

A basic x86 operating system written in assembly.

Phoenix was a experimental bootdisk that I created to learn and experiment with.
The system was codenamed Phoenix and was kept proprietary for a while.

For more information please see the markdown readme file. This can be viewed 
with a markdown viewer or on github.
